## Tutorial: Accessing Downloads of Popular Discovery Channel Series & Episodes for Free

### Overview

* I want to download some Discovery.com videos for viewing when travelling to America. Can you recommend a workable Discovery.com downloader for my need? Thanks.

Discovery.com is the website for users to watch live streams and full episodes from Discovery Channel. Watching a little part of Discovery videos does not need users to sign in, but Discovery does need users to sign in with the supported TV provider to watch the most of Discovery videos.

However, no matter whether you sign in or not, you can not download any Discovery channel video to your personal computer or mobile device for offline playback. To enable Discovery video downloading, users should choose a professional Discovery.com downloader, like Allavsoft, to help these users who have the Discovery video downloading need. And also, using Allavsoft to download Discovery videos could also benefit users who want to archive Discovery videos or who are live outside of America, since Discovery.com will provide videos in certain periods or prohibit users to access Discovery.com videos outside of America.
