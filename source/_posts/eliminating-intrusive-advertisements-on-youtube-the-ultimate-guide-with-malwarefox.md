## Remove ads on YouTube by Downloading Videos

It is possible to download videos from YouTube on to your computer for easy offline viewing at any time or place. You can download YouTube videos using third-party websites such as Clip Grab. And if this process gets a little too cumbersome or confusing for you, adding **ss** into the video’s URL lets you download the videos directly from YouTube. The format is as follows –  https://www.ssyoutube.com However, sometimes you may have too many videos to view that consume so much time to download and some much more data. Thus, downloading your videos may not be the best option to avoid YouTube Ads.

The use of high-quality and trusted YouTube Adblockers is perhaps the most reliable and easiest way to block Ads when streaming your YouTube videos.

Use Ad blockers that are proven to be effective such as [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ad-blocker/kacljcbejojnapnmiifgckbafkojcncf). For the not-to-Tech-informed, going through reputable online reviews on the best Ad blockers also helps you choose the right one.

You can simply do block Ads by copying the URL of the video you want to stream, and then open pages like [Adless Tube](https://youtubenoad.com/) or [ViewPure](http://www.viewpure.com/), and copy the video URL into their search space. These Ad blocking pages work by removing the Ad for the video URL thus, letting you stream them without clutter.

## Other Possibilities

YouTube partner programs such as AdSense lets the viewer filter through Ads powered by them when you are streaming YouTube videos and channels. Simply log into AdSense, go to the “Allow and Block Ads” tab and click on the top-left drop-down menu. Then, click on “Blocking Controls” then choose “YouTube Host”. The pages give you two blocking options – you can either block specific advertisement URLS or generally block all AdSense powered Advertisements. To block specific advertisements, click on the “Advertiser URLs” tab at the top f the page, enter the Url in the space provided then click on “Block URLs”. To block all advertisements, pick the categories on the same page. The added changes are then automatically saved and reflect on YouTube streaming in 24 hours. This option is limited because it will only block Ads powered under AdSense thus; other Ads will still freely pop up in your YouTube streaming experience.
