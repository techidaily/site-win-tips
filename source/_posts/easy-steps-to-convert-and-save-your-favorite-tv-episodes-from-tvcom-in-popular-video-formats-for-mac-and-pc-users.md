### Why Need Allavsoft to Download TV Shows from TV.com

The TV shows or other videos on TV.com are not available forever due to the periodical licenses. If the license for the TV shows is not renewed then the TV shows will be gone. And also not all TV shows or other videos are available on every location. Almost all TV shows or other videos on TV.com are only available in USA. So for those who like to download TV shows for collection or for watching outside of USA, Allavsoft can be both a good helper.
