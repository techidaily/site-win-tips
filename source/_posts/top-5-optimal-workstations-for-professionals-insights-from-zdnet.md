## How did we choose these desks?

The perfect desk is easily the most crucial piece of your office furniture. Without a decent modern desk and comfortable chair, your office space will be the last place you want to spend time. 

The most suitable desk will help your workflow and productivity, and it will be comfortable to work at for long periods. Your desk should match your style and complement your other home office furniture. Most importantly, it should be optimal for the type of work you will be doing. 

## Why style of desk do I need?

There are tons of different kinds of desks out there: standing, L-shaped, executive, writing... I could go on. The best way to narrow down your choices is to figure out exactly how you'll be using your desk and what your personal work style is:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Desk use 

* **Computer work:** Be sure to choose a desk suited for computer work with wiring holes, electrical outlets, and, if need be, plenty of room for a CPU underneath.
* **Paper-work generating:** You will want a desk with lots of surface space and then space to store your work like drawers, or overhead shelves, or cabinets.
* **For a tight space:** Computer armoires are becoming popular because you can close the doors and hide away unsightly hardware. L-shaped desks, fold-out desks, compact computer desks, corner desks, or computer carts all fit into small spaces.
* **Office area:** Which room will your desk be in? Ideally, you will want a room to be your dedicated office. However, any living room can act as a home office as long as it is orderly and there are no distractions during work hours.

### Work style

* **Neatfreak:** If you keep your workspace highly organized and clutter-free, then you can get away with a small desk if you need to.
* **Organized chaos:** If you work in a space where you know what everything is, but anyone else would be lost, you may want a desk with a bigger surface area.

## Why are desks so expensive?

The short answer is: you can thank the shift a lot of companies have made to hybrid or work-from-home situations rather than in a traditional office setting. More people are shopping for desks to use in their homes, which has driven up prices.

The long answer is: desks are made for a variety of functions, and they are made from a wide range of materials. A desk that is made out of real, solid wood is going to cost a lot more than a flat-pack, particle board model you can get at a big-box retailer. Similarly, ergonomic desks have a lot of science and engineering behind them, so companies price them higher to offset the cost of development.

The best way to determine your new desk budget is to determine whether you want something built for durability and ergonomics or something more simple for short-term work.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Quality and durability

* **Drawer construction:** You can usually tell the quality of a desk by looking at its drawer construction. Do the drawers easily open and close while holding weight? Do the drawers open fully to utilize all the drawer space? Do they have a sturdy suspension? Metal suspension rollers are the most durable.
* **Corners and edges:** When you examine the desk, are there any fraying or damaged pieces?
* **The warranty:** The warranty on your desk can tell you more about its quality, durability, and life expectancy. Warranties range anywhere from a one-year warranty to a lifetime warranty.

### Desk surface

* **Laminate:** This is the most popular choice because it is affordable and relatively durable. Laminate is made by covering the wood in a plastic finish in multiple colors and wood grain patterns.
* **Metal or steel:** This is the most durable option. Black metal in particular is reasonably priced, and you can easily determine the quality by checking to see how heavy the desk is. If you need your desk for heavy or long-term use, a desk with a metal frame may be the best option for you.
* **Wood or veneer:** If your go-to style is elegance and you are not worried about being careful with wear and tear, this is an attractive choice. This type of desk looks more beautiful and is usually more expensive, but it is easily nicked and not suited for heavy use.

## Are standing desks good for you?

Whether you buy a standing or sitting desk is going to depend a lot on your personal preference as well as the type of work you'll be doing. Traditional sitting desks are more affordable and can offer much more working surface area but can be hard on the body if you work long hours. 

Standing desks can cost more, depending on if they have an electric motor or piston system rather than simply being built taller, and they have the added benefit of helping to keep your body moving and blood flowing rather than sitting in a static position all day.

If you're torn between a sitting and standing desk, take this into consideration:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Ergonomics and space

* **Legroom:** Most desks are 29 or 30 inches, which is enough for most people. But if you are taller, consider an adjustable desk. Many standing desks are adjustable.
* **Spacing:** Be sure to measure your workspace to ensure plenty of space for you sitting behind the desk and other furniture. Consider installing a basic cable management system to give yourself as much desk and leg space as possible, especially if you use many different chargers.
* **Keyboard space:** If you are using a keyboard, it may be more comfortable to position it below the desk or get a desk with adjustable legs. Also, be aware of how big the keyboard platform is if it needs to hold a mouse.
* **Nearby materials:** Be sure your desktop is large enough to keep everything you need within reach for your convenience.
* **Desk storage:** How much storage space will you need? Consider whether you will need extra shelving, bookshelves, file cabinets, or any other storage to put away office supplies and help you stay organized.
