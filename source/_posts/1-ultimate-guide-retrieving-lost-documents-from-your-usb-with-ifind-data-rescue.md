All of these are different Examples of U disk failure. The main reason for these failures is that the MBR of U disk is damaged, which makes Windows unable to recognize the file system of U disk.

After these faults occur, we first suggest using the repairing tools provided by [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chkdsk) to repair the damaged U disk. The windows built-in chkdsk are relatively safe and can be used safely. The success rate for repair is about 50%.

**Step 1:** Select the U disk, right-click, select “_Properties_” from the pop-up menu, and then select “_Tool_” from the pop-up windows.
