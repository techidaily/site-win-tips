Hi All,  
 I know how to setup comment for the whole line. If I want a inline comment, how can I set it? Also, if I have more than 2 comments, how can I set it up?  
 I am tried to setup a configuration for SPICE file (a circuit simulation file). SPICE file has three types of commands.  
 \* line comment  
 $ line comment  
 ; inline comment, it can insert a line and comments everything after it.  
 How to set this up?  
 Thanks.

 Can you give me more examples of the inline comment?  
 Currently, there is no way to setup more than two line comments in EmEditor.

Here is an example of inline command.  
 r1 n1 gnd 10K ; resistor divider 1  
 r2 vdd n1 10k ; resistor divider 2  
 Here ; is used as inline comment. It comments everything after it.  
 Please consider adding this feature.  
 Thanks.

 Thanks for your explanation. In this case, inline comment is the same as line comment.
